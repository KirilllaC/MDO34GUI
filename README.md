# MDO34GUI
This is a MATLAB App that allows the Tektronix MDO34 and an to be used for frequency domain analysis by performing a swept sine analysis using an External Generator (currently R&S SML 03 and Agilent 33250A are supported.  The MATLAB App installation file is: MDO34 Signal Analyzer.mlappinstall

The directions I used for downloading and installing necessary drivers are in the file "Tek MDO34 Software.pdf".  I think there may be more steps than necessary in the file, but it worked for me.

More information and directions for using the app that was used a base for my program are available at: http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/MDO34Gui/
